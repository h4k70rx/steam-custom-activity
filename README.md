* This application gives you ability to set custom activity through steam launcher.

* Everything you need to do is to add this application in steam launcher as shortcut, after that rename it from there with custom text (activity) you want and just start it!

* Application is invisible, so you dont need to minimize it or etc. and when you want to stop it, just start it again (it will turn it off, just like switch).
